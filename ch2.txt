I am going to and as a matter of fact I am on my way to becoming the greatest, and I'll own the sexiest fleet of exotic cars and bikes and most importantly , I am going to own a private jet.
If these people like Will Smith, The Rock and Akshay Kumar can do it, why can't I?
I am gonna work as hard as possible and make sure (heck.. it is fuckin sure ) that get into the ranks of the top 0.000001% of the population of India and the world.
